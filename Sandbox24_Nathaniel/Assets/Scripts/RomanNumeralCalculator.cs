    /*  If you don't know how Roman Numerals work, head to this link https://www.dictionary.com/e/roman-numerals/
     *  
     *  TODO: Get the input gameobject
     *  TODO: Make the button grab the input from the user and run the calculation
     *  TODO: Put the calculation in the output when its done
     *  
     *  Bonus Points if you filter the output to only numbers and display an error message if letters are present!
     *  
     *  If you think you've done it or would like some guidance, feel free to show me (Nathaniel) in class and I can give you tips
